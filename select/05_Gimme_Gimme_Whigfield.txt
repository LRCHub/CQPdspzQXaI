Day by day
I'm getting closer to you
There's a way
Somehow I gotta get trough
Face to face
If I could have what I need
Then for sure all my love would be free

Oh yeah

Kiss by kiss
I'm getting closer to your heart
And if this
Something good gotta start
Face to face
If I could say what I know
Then for sure all my loving would flow

Gimme gimme
Gimme the time of my life
Show me show me
Show me the love in your eyes
Gimme gimme
You got me feeling alright
So right so right oh yeah

Nanananananana
Nanananananana

Inside out
That's what I feel when you're there
Not a doubt
Boy I know that you care
Face to face
If I could have what I need
You would stay... by me

Kiss by kiss
I'm getting closer to your heart
And if this
Something good gotta start
Face to face
If I could say what I know
Then for sure all my loving would flow

Gimme gimme
Gimme the time of my life
Show me show me
Show me the love in your eyes
Gimme gimme
You got me feeling alright
So right so right oh yeah
